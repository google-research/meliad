  """Returns a position encoding of shape (num_positions, input_dim).

  Positions are encoded as sin/cos pairs at geometrically increasing
  wavelengths.

  The length of a half-wave (peak to trough) increases geometrically from 1 to
  max_wavelength.  (Technically, it's slightly less; the last sin/cos pair has
  a wavelength of max_wavelength**((d-1)/d), where d = input_dim/2.)

  NOTE: unlike prior published position encodings, we multiply the position of
  each token by pi to convert from fractions of a wave (position/wavelength)
  to radians.  Thus, the highest frequency wave alternates between -1 and 1 on
  every token, whereas in prior published work the highest frequency alternates
  between -1 and 1 every pi tokens.  The max_wavelength is also effectively
  1/pi times as long, so a prior published factor of 10,000
  (e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) would equate to a max_wavelength
  of 31,416.

  This encoding also does not alternate between sin/cos values, but puts all of
  the cos values on one side, and the sin values on the other.  That makes it
  easier to split the sin,cos values to construct or apply a rotation matrix.

  The default value for max_wavelength is 2 * num_positions.

  Args:
    num_positions:  The number of positions.
    input_dim:      The dimension of the position vector.
    *:  --- The following are keyword arguments only. ---
