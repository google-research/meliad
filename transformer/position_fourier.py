"""Class for Fourier relative position biases.

This implementation uses the same Fourier position encodings that are used
in the absolute position encoding.  However, instead of adding the positions
to the input, where the position vector and content vectors become entangled,
the relative encoding computes a relative position bias matrix, which is then
added to the content-based attention matrix before applying softmax.

The bias matrix is computed as follows.  First, a learned transformation is
applied to each query position, which transforms it so that it matches a set
of key positions. The relative position bias between query 'i' and key 'j' is
the dot product between the transformed position 'i', and position 'j'.

The learned transformation is designed so that the match between query and key
is a function of the relative distance between the two.  Although absolute
positions are fed as inputs, the rest of the network can't "see" the absolute
positions; it can only transform them by some relative amount.

A position vector consists of a sequence of (sin, cos) pairs, which have
geometrically increasing wavelengths that span from 2 (for the first pair
in each vector) to twice the length of the token sequence (for the last pair).
Each sin/cos pair encodes the (x, y) value of a 2D unit vector at a particular
angle.  For each sin/cos pair in the query position vector, we apply a learned
2x2 rotation matrix, which will rotate and scale the pair by some amount.

The dot product of two (sin, cos) pairs is the cosine of the angle between them.
The dot product of the query position and key position vectors is thus the sum
of such cosines. By rotating and scaling the query position, it is possible to
approximate any function over relative position as a Fourier series: a sum of
cosine waves at different wavelengths. The rotation provides phase, and the
scale provides magnitude.

Put another way, rotating the (sin, cos) pairs of a query position will compute
a relative offset from the /query/ position to some target /key/ position.
